<p>Last updated and effective: <strong>May 4, 2019</strong></p>

<p>Privacy matters to us. If you have questions about any of the following information, please send an email to contact@representus.app and we will get back to you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>RepresentUs was designed to provide users an easy way to stay up to date with actions taken by their Representatives in the United State Senate and House of Representatives. All data found in this application is taken directly or derived* from data collected from publicly available and official US Government sources. At no point did RepresentUs make an attempt to alter or inject any bias into the provided information.</p>

<p>*Derived data refers to sections such as the “party loyalty” metric on a Representative’s about page. The information found here is ‘derived’ from data that is found from official sources and is not original content created by RepresentUs. “Party loyalty” is determined by how often a Representative votes in conjunction with the majority if their respective party. An “abstain” is counted as a vote against the party and therefore affects “party loyalty”. “Party loyalty” is in no way meant to be construed as a description of the character of any person, but rather as a purely numerical analysis of their voting record.</p>

<h3 id="the-data-we-collect">The data we collect</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>UDID or Unique Device Identifier</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The UDID or Unique Device Identifier is a device specific
  number that has no relation to you or your personal information. This ID is  used to track “reactions” to Representative
  voting records and ensure accurate “reaction” counts by preventing multiple “reactions” from the same device.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Zip Code</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>RepresentUs takes user privacy very seriously. We understand that political opinions are often not shared. For this reason, RepresentUs does not and will not track highly accurate user location information. Instead, RepresentUs only keeps track of the zip code of each UDID. This allows users a sufficient amount of privacy, prevent the deduction of which reactions belong to which users.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Link Sharing Statistics</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>When a link is shared from the app, RepresentUs tracks user interactions with that link. This, like the topics listed above, is done in the same anonymous fashion. Neither personal information about the user who created the link nor information about the users who click on the link is tracked.</p>

<h3 id="what-we-use-it-for">What we use it for</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>General location-based political sentiments</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The chief responsibility of a United States Representative is to accurately represent the desires of their constituents on the Senate and/or House floor. It can be frustrating as a constituent to see our Representative voting on policies that we do not agree with. RepresentUs aims to bridge this divide by allowing Representatives to get quick and accurate feedback directly from their constituents.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding how political information is shared on Social Media platforms</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>An important aspect of the political system of the United States is the participation of all of the citizens in the election process. One reason often cited for people’s lack of participation is their lack of knowledge as to what is going on or what their representatives are doing in the House and the Senate. Today, Social Media plays a key role in the dissemination of information. By tracking anonymous location-based interaction with data provided by RepresentUs, we hope to understand what sparks the interest of people and encourage more friendly political discourse.</p>

<h3 id="opting-out-of-data-collection">Opting out of data collection</h3>

<p>RepresentUs has no way of determining which UDID belongs to which user, so we are therefore unable to delete data that we have collected from your device should you wish us to do so. If you wish to opt-out of data collection, you must cease use of the app.</p>

<h3 id="revisions-to-this-privacy-policy">Revisions to this privacy policy</h3>

<p>Any changes to this privacy policy will be accompanied by an app update, at which time you will be once again prompted to read it.</p>

<h3 id="california-do-not-track-disclosure">California Do Not Track Disclosure</h3>

<p>At the time of writing, this application does not have a mobile browser variant and is therefore unable to receive “Do Not Track” signals.</p>
